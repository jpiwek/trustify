**Story**
------------------------
Makers developed a secure platform during COVID-19 period to support communities and device manufacturers on re-thinking security strategies for their future product roadmap. This platform design demonstrates how to protect digital assets, firmware, intellectual property and keys by design. 

  - *MCU*: SAML11 - CortexM23 with TrustZone Hypervisor 
  - *Secure Element*: JIL rated ATECC608A Trust & Go with pre-provisioned certificate chain, keys
  - *Programmer / Debugger*: Microchip low cost SNAP / PicKIT4
  - *Expansion Connectors*: Mikroelektronika Click / Microchip Xplained
  - *Interfaces*: FTDI USB to UART Bridge for debugging and powering the board

**Examples**
------------------------
The "Board Teset" example is built with Microchip MPLAB-X & Harmony v3. It gives you a good starting point for your own project.
